Fiza lived inside a giant glowing library where every product in ShopLand was stored as a unique key–value pair.
If a customer searched for “Red Crystal Shoes”, Fiza would instantly unlock the corresponding key and present the exact item faster than magic itself.
He could store thousands of items, each with its own ID, name, price, and description — and retrieve them without ever getting confused.
Whenever ShopLand needed a new idea or feature, Fiza simply added a new entry into his HashMap realm, making the system smarter every day.
