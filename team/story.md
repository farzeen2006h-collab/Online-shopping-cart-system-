Sara wanted to buy a new pair of headphones, so she opened the online store on her laptop. She browsed through the electronics section, clicked on a model she liked, and added it to her shopping cart. The system instantly updated her cart, showing the new item and total price. Before checking out, Sara compared a few more items and removed one she no longer wanted—the system recalculated everything automatically. When she clicked Checkout, the cart transferred her items to the order system, where she entered her address and payment details. Within seconds, she received a confirmation message saying her order was successfully placed. Thanks to the smooth and responsive cart system, Lina’s shopping experience was fast, easy, and stress-free.
